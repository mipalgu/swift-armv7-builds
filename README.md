# Swift armv7 builds

This repository contains Swift builds for 32-bit ARMv7 processors, such as the Raspberry Pi 2 (also compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 in 32-bit mode).

These builds were created using [our fork](https://github.com/mipalgu/buildSwiftOnARM) of [uraimo](https://github.com/uraimo)'s excellent [buildSwiftOnARM](https://github.com/uraimo/buildSwiftOnARM) scripts.
